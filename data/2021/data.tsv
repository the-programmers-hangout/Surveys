C++, Java, Python, C, C#, Dart, Bash	C++, Python, C	C. It gives you just the right amount of control over the program. Not too little that it becomes a problem and not too much that you fuck everything up by accident all the time. Most (well-designed) libraries for C are easy enough to use, and when it works, its my favorite language.	I absolutely despise javascript. Optional semicolons? Weak typing? The fact that it overcomplicates everything? No thanks. And now through some horrifying new technology, it now runs everywhere. Desktop, mobile, you name it. Its becoming a staple of programming, mostly because it took Java's (and similar languages) write once run everywhere model way too far. And now even though performance suffers greatly, its still used because its "easier". It's sure as hell not easier for the user, who has to deal with the gigantic program size because of all the dependencies. Or the massive amount of RAM usage because its running a whole separate browser window. Back to dependencies for a sec. JS is known for its dependency hell. Remember left-pad? *internal screaming*. And theres entire packages to tell if a number is odd or even. I dont even know if those are jokes. Chrome/Chromium is a notorious memory hog; why would anyone even think "Hey, what if I made every app run on Chromium?". Like at least make something more efficient if you're trying to make a unified platform. At least Sun and Oracle had the decency to cram every possible optimization into the JVM to make it more efficient. All these companies creating js frameworks just used Chromium, an independent platform out of their control that they can't optimize due to it being out of their hands. Sure, its good that they have one open source standard, but why couldn't it be anything but Chromium? Why can't they just make another open-source interpreter/vm that's actually MEANT to run js outside the browser? It does have its use cases but it should never be a replacement for true desktop apps written in a better language. In conclusion, js sucks and should be reconfined to webdev so the rest of us dont have to deal with it (or learn to deal with it).	I'd like to learn more about Docker.

C++, Python, Bash	Python	Python. It's very flexible in terms of writing code and mixing up different modules.  Also one of the good thing in python is that, it doesn't force OOP style, you either do modular programming or anything you like.  Another thing is, the collection of many modules which let the programmer to focus on creative side and let the mechanics run by those modules or package. Although I don't actually like using these modules at first when writing the code at least programmer shoud know how things are working in the behind instead of guessing and doesn't worrying at all...

JavaScript, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, C#, PHP, Rust, TypeScript, Haskell, Swift, PureScript	JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift	TLDR: Swift or Haskell (leaning towards more Haskell right now). Also Rust and TypeScript are nice.  A few months ago, I would have said Swift because of its familiar C-like syntax, strong type system, nice features like names parameters, trailing closures, function builders, protocols, and that its compiled. Now, I’m not sure. Haskell is also a beautiful language (I love FP), and is lazy, statically typed, and lazy, but has a bad base/builtins due to historical reasons. PureScript has a good base, but it compiles to JS, which is very versatile but not performant. Rust is my favourite for low-level stuff due to its functional style and borrowing system. TypeScript is probably the most useful language and the one that I have used the most as it has a static type system yet compiled to JS, which can be used in the browser or server.	Java. Honorary mention to PHP for its inconsistency and weird stuff.  I hate OOP. I hate how function types have to be wrapped up in a stupid interface and how everything to be in a fucking class. How inheritance complicates everything and how verbose a simple ‘hello world’ is. I hate how you have to put utility functions in a Util class that isn’t even what a class should be in OOP. It serves just to hold static functions because fucking Oracle doesn’t want to allow top-level functions. Alan Kay’s original idea of OOP is actually not bad, but it has now become a fucking mess, partially caused by Java. And Java isn’t even performant!	Dependent types, probably Agda	I start a project but quickly lose motivation and usually don't complete a project	A least once per month	I contribute to mainly OSS that I use, so it’s nice to give back and fix a bug that you also want desperately fixed. It’s also a chance for me to apply my programming skills and knowledge to something useful and for me to learn something new and best practices, especially as just a high school teenager.

At the moment, modern Haskell is the most practical realization of that - things like -XDataKinds and -XTypeFamilies let me leverage a lot of fancy types but with the bonus of full type erasure at runtime and a decently big library ecosystem. An honorable mention goes to Rust, which is much more on the "efficiency" and "practicality" side of things, but is also a really pleasant language imo	Go - despite being marketed as a modern language, it doesn't really have any features that I'd consider as such; after coming from writing a lot of Rust/Haskell, where map/filter/etc are everywhere, going back to writing for loops and ifs by hand feels super slow by comparison. Having no polymorphism/generics makes the development experience even worse, as casting to/from interface{} constantly feels like a terrible unsafe way of getting things done.

JavaScript, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, C#, PHP, TypeScript, Lua	JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, TypeScript	TypeScript is my favorite programming language as it brings together the concepts of multiple languages, joined together into a form that builds upon and improves JavaScript. However, I have recently been learning C# and find it much more satisfying to code in as it feels cleaner and more stable than TypeScript or JavaScript, but it takes a bit longer to code in C# than JS or TS.	Ignoring Assembly for obvious reasons, CSS is my least favorite programming language as it requires large amount of redundant code to write code compatible with different screen sizes and browsers. In addition, you can't simply debug CSS with traditional methods and typically end up being forced into trial and error.	I have been planning to start development with React, Angular, and Vue yet I lack the motivation to actually start working with them as I have no real reason besides learning a new framework.
