# The Programmer's Hangout 2022 Survey Report

This report details the condensed results of The Programmer's Hangout 2022 Survey. There were a total of 365 responses. Thank you so much to everyone that took the time to respond! This ended up being a very similar response sample to last year which is great to see. Over the last year we've taken on board a lot of your suggestions and complaints. We've altered our nickname policy and direction given to staff (as you can see with the `+nickpolicy` macro). We've introduced more spotlights suggested and written by you. We've added and altered channels to incorporate more discussion topics. We've also updated and improved our general staff direction in terms of moderation on TPH. Ultimately our goal is to make The Programmer's Hangout the best place for programmers to be and with your feedback this year we can hopefully continue to do that. We want the environment to be as welcoming and engaging as possible for every programmer.
